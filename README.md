# GChart Helper
Google visualization API wrapper helper for CakePHP

## Purpose
To add a simple API within CakePHP to create line, bar, area, and pie charts.

## Installation

- Clone g_chart into your helpers directory (either main app folder or plugin)

	`git clone git://github.com/cjsaylor/Google-visualization-api-cakephp.git . `

- Add as a git submodule

	`git submodule add git://github.com/cjsaylor/Google-visualization-api-cakephp.git . `

## Notes

Currently Supports the following visualizations:
* Area Chart
* Bar Chart
* Pie Chart
* Line Chart

I have plans to add support with additional visualization (namely, Gauge is next on the list).
